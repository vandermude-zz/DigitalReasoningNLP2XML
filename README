This project tackles the following problems:

1. Write a program that identifies sentence boundaries and tokenizes the text in the file “ nlp_data.txt ” into words. It should correctly process all symbols, including punctuation and whitespace. Every word must fall into a sentence. Create data structures that efficiently express the data you have processed. When your program runs it should output an XML representation of your Java object model.

2. Modify your program from #1 to add rudimentary recognition of proper nouns (“named entities”) in the input, and print a list of recognized named entities when it runs. The list of named entities is in the file “ NER.txt ”. Enhance your data structures and output schema to store information about which portions of the text represent named entities.

3. Modify your program from #2 to use “ nlp_data.zip ” as its input. Use a thread pool to parallelize the processing of the text files contained in the zip. Aggregate the results and modify the output schema accordingly.

The second release handles the second exercise.

NOTE: This code does not include any unit tests.

The code consists of three classes:
NamedEntityRecognizer.java  NLP2XMLNER.java  Tokenizer.java
NLP2XML.java                Parser.java

The code compiles using Eclipse Kepler without any outside libraries, except:
java.io.*
java.util.*
javax.xml.*
org.w3c.dom.*

The main function is now in NLP2XMLNER.java
It takes one required input text file name and two optional output file names and an optional Part Of Speech dictionary
If the output file names are not there, the output goes to stdout.
If the Part Of Speech Dictionary is not given, it is not used.

In Eclipse, calling
NLP2XMLNER resources/nlp_data.txt  resources/nlp_data.xml  resources/nlp_data.ner
will read the text and store the XML in nlp_data.xml and the Named Entities in nlp_data.ner

Calling
NLP2XMLNER resources/nlp_data.txt -p resources/mobyposi.txt resources/nlp_data.pos.xml  resources/nlp_data.pos.ner
will read the text and store the XML in nlp_data.pos.xml and the Named Entities in nlp_data.pos.ner
The outputs will differ because tje Part Of Speech dictionary was used.
